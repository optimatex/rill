      I've been a QA engineer with comp.sci background working in many places building quality tools for over 11 years. Last year during the pandemic most of my company was fired, including myself. So, I decided to apply for a web developer role at Napster. This video was literally all I used to do the technical exam. I am now finishing my probation period! Thanks, mate!
